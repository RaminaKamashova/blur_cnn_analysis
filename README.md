# blur_cnn_analysis
Deep learning project exploring how image blur affects CNN classification accuracy (CIFAR-10)

# The Effect of Image Blur on Classification Accuracy Using CNN

## Project Overview

This project analyzes how different levels of image blur (Gaussian and Median filters) affect the classification accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- OpenCV for image blurring
- Keras with TensorFlow backend
- Google Colab

## Experiments

- Trained on both original and blurred images
- Compared effects of varying blur levels
- Analyzed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## 📈 Key Findings

- Blur decreases accuracy by ~15–20%
- Median filter was less destructive than Gaussian
- “Cat” and “Bird” classes were the most sensitive to blur
- 
##  How to run 
Easy to start with Google Colab
